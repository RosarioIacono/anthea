      <description>&lt;p&gt;As cities expand and climate patterns shift, urban agriculture and vertical farming have become critical to building local food resilience. Yet, many of these cutting-edge growing systems rely on a centuries-old model of seed ownership. The open-source seed movement challenges this paradigm, offering a framework for collaboration that is essential for the sustainable growth of urban food production.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the controlled, high-tech environment of a vertical farm, every variable is optimized for growth—light, temperature, nutrients. But there&amp;rsquo;s one fundamental component that often remains locked in a proprietary system: the seed. Open-source seeds are emerging as a transformative force, poised to bridge this gap and create a more resilient, adaptable, and equitable foundation for the future of urban agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
