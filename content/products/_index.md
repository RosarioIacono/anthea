# Products: Biology-Enhanced Seedlings

Anthea produces high-quality seedlings with:

- **high uniformity** for ease of planning,
- **biological enhancement** via microbial and mycorrhizal inoculation,
- **environmental conditioning** tailored to target systems.

We focus on three main crop groups:

## Tomato Seedlings

- Varieties selected for flavour, resilience, and productivity.
- Suitable for **open field**, **greenhouses**, and **vertical farms**.
- Conditioned to promote early vigour and robust root systems.

## Cucurbit Seedlings

- Cucumbers, courgettes, and related crops.
- Tailored for farms working in **greenhouse**, **tunnel**, or **open field** systems.
- Emphasis on strong early growth and stress tolerance.

## Herb Seedlings

- Culinary herbs adapted to both professional and home-growing contexts.
- Compact growth with strong aroma.
- Options for vertical farming and retail-oriented production.
