# The Anthea Facility

Anthea’s facility combines a **futuristic, sustainable vertical nursery** with a **regenerative apple orchard**.

## Vertical Nursery

- Multi-layer growing systems without glass façades.
- Energy-efficient lighting and climate control.
- Designed for **precision, repeatability, and flexibility**.

## Regenerative Orchard

- Diversified apple orchard surrounding the building.
- Managed with regenerative practices to enhance soil life and biodiversity.
- Serves as a real-world testbed for seedlings and varieties.

## Why This Hybrid Design?

- The vertical nursery lets us **spare land** by producing large numbers of seedlings in a compact footprint.
- The orchard lets us **give land back** to biodiversity and long-lived perennial systems.
- Together, they form a **demonstration site** for hybrid approaches to future farming.

Over time, we aim to open the facility for:

- field days,
- workshops,
- collaborative experiments with farmers and researchers.
