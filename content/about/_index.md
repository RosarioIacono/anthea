# About Anthea

Anthea is an open-source horticultural biotechnology initiative focused on creating the next generation of **high-uniformity, biology-enhanced seedlings** for European agriculture.

We are:

- growers and researchers,
- open-source advocates,
- deeply rooted in both **data** and **soil**.

Our mission is to make advanced plant material **transparent, shareable, and adaptable**, not locked away.

*(Here you can later add team bios, affiliations, etc.)*
