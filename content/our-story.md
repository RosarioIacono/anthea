### Why We Started  

Anthea began with a frustration and a dream.  
I saw how **vertical farms were full of technology and potential**, but the seeds they used were still made for fields and greenhouses.  
It didnâ€™t make sense. The plants werenâ€™t keeping up with the farms.  

So we asked: *what if seeds were designed for vertical farming from the start?*

### The Open Source Path  

We didnâ€™t want to lock seeds behind patents or keep innovation in silos.  
Seeds are too important for that.  

Thatâ€™s why Anthea is **open source** â€” a place where farmers, researchers, and communities can **co-create varieties** and **share knowledge**.  
Together, we can move faster, protect biodiversity, and make sure the future of food is accessible to everyone.

### Looking Ahead  

Weâ€™re still at the beginning, but weâ€™ve already taken important steps:  
- Working with scientists and vertical farms to run experiments.  
- Supported by programs like **EIT Food Fellowship** and **Weinberg Campus Elevator**.  
- Building a community of people who care about the future of food.  

This is just the start.  
Anthea is more than a project â€” itâ€™s a movement for open seeds and better farming.
