## Our Story

Anthea was born from a simple idea: to make high-quality seeds for vertical farming accessible to everyone. We noticed that most indoor farming varieties were locked behind proprietary systems, limiting innovation and slowing progress. Our founders, passionate about both plant breeding and open collaboration, decided to take a different path.

We combine advanced breeding techniques with a community-driven, open-source approach. By sharing our varieties freely, we empower growers, researchers, and innovators to adapt and improve seeds for their unique environments. Every step we take, from selecting traits to testing in controlled environments, is guided by the goal of creating resilient, high-performing crops while fostering a collaborative, transparent food system.

Anthea is more than a seed company—it’s a movement to unlock the full potential of vertical farming and shape the future of sustainable agriculture together.

### Why We Started

Anthea began with a frustration and a dream.  
We saw how **vertical farms were full of technology and potential**, but the seeds they used were still made for fields and greenhouses.  
It didn’t make sense. The plants weren’t keeping up with the farms.

So we asked: *what if seeds were designed for vertical farming from the start?*

### The Open Source Path

We didn’t want to lock seeds behind patents or keep innovation in silos.  
Seeds are too important for that.

That’s why Anthea is **open source** — a place where farmers, researchers, and communities can **co-create varieties** and **share knowledge**.  
Together, we can move faster, protect biodiversity, and make sure the future of food is accessible to everyone.

### Looking Ahead

We’re still at the beginning, but we’ve already taken important steps:  
- Working with scientists and vertical farms to run experiments.  
- Supported by programs like **EIT Food Fellowship** and **Weinberg Campus Elevator**.  
- Building a community of people who care about the future of food.

This is just the start.  
Anthea is more than a project — it’s a movement for open seeds and better farming.

🌱 **Join us and let’s grow it together.**
