### Seeds for Vertical Farms  

Anthea develops **open-source seeds optimized for vertical farming**.  
Our varieties are tested in controlled environments, with traits like:  
- 🌱 Compact growth  
- 💡 Efficient use of light  
- 💧 Better performance in hydroponics  

We are currently running trials and building a **catalog of varieties** for farmers who want higher yields and sustainability indoors.  

➡️ **Coming soon: Open variety catalog 2025.**
