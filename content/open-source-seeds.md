### Seeds Belong to Everyone  

We believe seeds should be **a common good**, not locked behind patents.  
Anthea uses the **Open Source Seed license** to guarantee:  
- Seeds remain free for use, sharing, and breeding.  
- Innovation happens collaboratively, not in silos.  
- Agrobiodiversity is preserved for future generations.  

üåç **Join the community**: help us test, breed, and share new varieties.
