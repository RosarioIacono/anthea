  # Anthea — Open-Source Seedling Biotechnology for the Future of Agriculture

Anthea develops the next generation of high-uniformity, biology-enhanced seedlings for European farms.

We combine controlled-environment precision, microbial and mycorrhizal enhancement, and open-source genetics to create seedlings that are ready for **open field, greenhouses, agrivoltaics, and vertical farms**.

## Why Anthea?

- Farms are facing **climate stress, labour shortages and volatile markets**.
- Seed systems are becoming more **closed and proprietary**.
- Young plants are often **weakly conditioned** for real-world field conditions.

Anthea exists to restore **resilience, transparency and adaptability** in plant material.

## A Hybrid Agricultural Platform

We operate as a hybrid platform:

- A **500 m² vertical nursery**, functioning as a precision conditioning lab.
- A **regenerative orchard**, acting as a living field laboratory for agroecology and biodiversity.
- An **open-source genetics backbone**, ensuring that varieties remain accessible, improvable, and shareable.

This hybrid model lets us spare land with compact indoor propagation and return land to regenerative use.

## What We Offer

- **Biology-enhanced seedlings** of tomato, cucurbits, and herbs.
- Seedlings tailored to **open field, greenhouse, agrivoltaic systems, and vertical farms**.
- Access to **open-source varieties** with transparent licensing.
- A research-driven approach grounded in plant physiology, microbiology, and agroecology.

## Open-Source Seeds, Open Future

We believe that the genetic basis of our food system should be a **commons**, not a black box.

Our varieties will be released under open-source seed licenses that:

- forbid monopolisation by patents,
- allow anyone to use, reproduce and breed,
- invite farmers and breeders into the improvement loop.

## Science Meets Practice

Anthea stands at the intersection of:

- **Vertical farming** as a precision engineering platform,
- **Microbial and mycorrhizal symbioses** as biological leverage,
- **Regenerative orchards** as real-world testing grounds.
