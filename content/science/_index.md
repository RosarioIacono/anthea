# Science at Anthea

Anthea stands at the intersection of **vertical farming, plant physiology, microbiology, and agroecology**.

We focus on four main areas:

## Environmental Conditioning

We use controlled-environment agriculture as a platform to:

- tune light spectra and intensity,
- modulate temperature, humidity, and VPD,
- standardise irrigation and nutrient regimes.

This allows us to test how early-life conditions affect **later performance in the field**.

## Microbial and Mycorrhizal Inoculation

We study and apply:

- beneficial arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi,
- plant growth-promoting microbes.

Our goal is to create seedlings that arrive in the soil with a **ready-made microbial support network**.

## Vertical Farming as a Precision Tool

Rather than aiming to move all food into vertical farms, we use vertical farming as a **precision laboratory**:

- to run repeatable trials,
- to separate environmental and genetic effects,
- to prototype conditioning protocols before scaling to farms.

## Regenerative Orchard Experiments

Our regenerative orchard provides:

- long-term field conditions,
- a complex living ecosystem for seedlings to prove themselves,
- a space where **data meets landscape**.

We see Anthea as an evolving field laboratory where **science and practice co-design better plants**.
