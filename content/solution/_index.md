# Our Solution: A Hybrid Platform for Open-Source Seedlings

Anthea combines three elements into a single platform:

## 1. Vertical Nursery as Precision Lab

Our vertical nursery allows us to:

- control light spectrum, intensity, and photoperiod,
- modulate temperature, humidity, VPD, and CO₂,
- standardise nutrient supply and irrigation.

This makes early growth **repeatable and optimisable**.

## 2. Biological Enhancement

We inoculate seedlings with **beneficial microbes and mycorrhizal fungi**, aiming to:

- improve nutrient acquisition,
- enhance stress tolerance,
- support healthier soil–root interactions after transplanting.

## 3. Regenerative Orchard as Field Lab

The nursery is embedded in a **regenerative apple orchard** that functions as a living testing ground:

- we expose seedlings and varieties to real climatic and soil variation,
- we monitor performance over seasons,
- we design for agroecological resilience, not just short-term yield.

Anthea’s solution is not just a different space to grow plants — it is a **new interface between precision horticulture and regenerative farming**, underpinned by **open-source genetics**.
