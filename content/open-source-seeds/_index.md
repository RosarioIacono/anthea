# Open-Source Seeds: Keeping Genetics in the Commons

Anthea is committed to **open-source seeds**.

Open-source seeds are plant varieties released under licenses that:

- **forbid appropriation** by patents or restrictive contracts,
- **allow anyone** to use, save, reproduce and breed with the seed,
- require that any further derived varieties remain **equally open**.

This creates a “copyleft” effect for plant genetics: the seed and all its descendants remain part of a **shared commons**.

## Why Open-Source?

- We want farmers to be **co-creators**, not just end-users.
- We want breeders and researchers to be able to **experiment, cross and share** without legal friction.
- We see open-source genetics as a foundation for **resilient, decentralised food systems**.

## How We Apply It

- Our own varieties will be released under open-source licenses.
- We aim to document:
  - variety characteristics,
  - performance in different systems,
  - best practices for seed saving and adaptation.

In the future, this page will host:

- **downloadable variety sheets**,  
- links to **repositories** with seed descriptions and trial data,  
- guides on how to **participate in breeding and evaluation**.
