# The Problem: Fragile Seeds in a Changing Climate

European farms face a convergence of pressures:

- **Climate variability**: heatwaves, late frosts, irregular rainfall.
- **Labour shortages** and rising input costs.
- **Market volatility** and pressure to deliver uniform quality.

At the same time, our seed systems are becoming more **centralised and proprietary**:

- key traits are locked behind restrictive licenses,
- farmers’ freedom to save, exchange, and adapt seeds is reduced,
- breeding pipelines often optimise for controlled environments, not diverse real fields.

The result is plants that are **less adaptable**, enter the field with **weak early vigour**, and require a narrow band of conditions to perform.

Anthea addresses this by focusing on **early life stages** — the seedling — and keeping the underlying genetics **open**.
